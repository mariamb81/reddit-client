# Reddit Lite

Mariam Busari, July 2022

## Inspiration

This application was my take on the "Build Your Own Reddit App" project on Codecademy.

## What it does

Reddit Lite Client allows users to view posts from reddit. Users can filter and search through subreddits to see posts from various communities across the web.

## Demo

### Homepage

### Filter posts by subreddit page

- Click a category on the left sidebar to see posts from that category
