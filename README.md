# Reddit Lite
Mariam Busari, July 2022

## Inspiration
This application was my take on the "Build Your Own Reddit App" project on Codecademy.

## What it does
Reddit Lite Client allows users to view posts from reddit. Users can filter and search through subreddits to see posts from various communities across the web.

## Built With
- React
- Redux

## Demo
